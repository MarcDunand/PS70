<h4>Paper Marbling Machine</h4>

I began this project at the beginning of last semester. I worked with David Selles who is in my same program and we were able to produce a fully functional prototype by hacking a laser cutter to work as an XY Gantry. We then attached several bags of ink to the head of the laser cutter along with a stick that can be used to create interference patterns in the ink. <br>
This semester, I would like to continue to build on this project through this class by replacing the hacked laser cutter with a coreXY system as well as improve the flow and control of the inks. <br>
Further, I would like to look into certain algorithms which can take in any digital image and convert it into a field of vectors which represents the image not through edge detection but through the alignment and misalignment of adjacent vectors.<br>
I am continuing to work with David Selles with additional advising from Quentin Bolsee.<br><br>
