<h4>Assignment 1: Make a Box</h4>

I decided to keep things very straightforward for my box, you'll find no frills on it at all. I started out by making this baby box:

Before upgrading to my full sized one:

<h4>Assignment 2: Fusion 360 Tutorial</h4>

Before this class, I have never worked with Fusion but I learned how to use Maya a long time ago. Up until this class, when I wanted to 3D model something I would always use Maya. I know full well that this is not Maya's optimal use case, but to get a handle on whether I personally feel better about modeling in Maya or in Fusion at this point, I did a quick tutorial, and then expanded upon it to create a frame for an ongoing project.

It's pretty incredible but I think that even already I prefer working with Fusion. I think it's really great that I'm learning to use this software!

<h4>Assignment 3: Fusion Modeling</h4>

For my models, I wanted to start with something simple. The first gift that I remember receiving is this canteen-like mug, so I tried my best to model it from memory. Here's how it turned out:

For the second model, I decided to take advantage of the assignment and cut out some components that I need for my final project for this course. Specifically, I need to build a gantry system and I am currently working on creating the prototype of that gantry. Components of the gantry are going to be laser cut wood and 3D printed PETG, so I did a first pass at cutting out all the components that I think I will need for the gantry. Though not exactly the same, you can find files similar to the ones I was working off of <a href="https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/quentinbolsee/urumbotxy-2.0/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads">here</a>.
