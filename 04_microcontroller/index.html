<h3>Week 4: Microcontroller Programming</h3>

<h4>Fine control with Paristaltic Pumps</h4>

Continuing from last week's wiring of my peristaltic pumps, the focus this week was to get fine computational control over the pumps.

These pumps will be used to drip single drops of ink onto my paper marbling and should also be capable of emptying all the ink held within the pump's tubes back into the reservoir.

<p class="margin">   </p>

This means that my goals are to 1: be able to manually control each individual pump to push liquid forward or backward, and 2: trigger brief forward pulses to my pumps which equate to a single drop of liquid being released from the head.

<p class="margin">   </p>

All of this also needs to be controllable from my computer, not the microcontroller, as my commputer will house the interface for designing and generating paper marblings.
